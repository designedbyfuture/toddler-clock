# toddler-clock
This repository contains ideas and implementations for teaching toddlers how to read the time.

Those clocks are named OK to wake from first glance. From that [link](https://www.littlepeachsleep.com/mommy-blog/sleep/what-ok-to-wake-clock-is-the-best) you can find a couple of good options as physical device.
But I am here to try something as a webpage as well.
I am a father of toddler who is trying to teach the concept of time and how to read hours. There are obvious problems about human clocks.
* It has generally 3 hand: hour, minute, second.
  * My opinion is I should have something with just hour. Minute and second is too detailed infromation for the age of 3.
* It has numbers and actually grown up people normally doesn't need that numbers. But recognizing digits is a bit challenging for toddlers. They are very good at distinguishing angle. So 9 PM is very easy to recognize for my son.
  * I believe a good toddler clock should have colors or any other child friendly indicators.
